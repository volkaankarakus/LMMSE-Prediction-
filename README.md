# LMMSE-Prediction-
Application of LMMSE Prediction metho applied for Video Compression Applications is shown.
As a first step, a 3-second voice recording is taken from the user.
The next bit is predicted using 32,64, and 128 bits of the 3 seconds audio signal respectively.
As the number of bits used increases, the error rate of the prediction bit decreases.(SNR)
For the obtained 128 bits of data, the 129th bit estimated value is given in Matlab Code, and the actual 129th bit and estimated 129th bit values are also compared.
The insignificant error rate obtained indicates that the LMMSE Prediction coefficients were calculated correctly.
